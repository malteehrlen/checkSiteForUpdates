CheckSiteForUpdates
This python script will e-mail you in case a site is updated. You can set the interval to periodically check. The script runs indefinitely, so use it with screen. It is useful if you dont want to add such a task to cron for some reason. It needs a sender email and a reciever, check the script to see where you need to input this info.

Also, probably pipe stdout to a log so you can see if the script is running.
